	\section*{Abstruct}
	The landscape of Bangladesh has a huge collection of inland waterways. Sedimentation of a river is a very natural process that lessens of navigability of a river. For our geographical position rivers of our country have high sedimentation rate. Besides dumping waste and plastics in to water not only causes water pollution, but also responsible for lessen navigability.\\ 
	Now a days, many of our rivers are dried up and may have lost their navigability. This reason has broken down our oldest 				transportation system.  Road transportation has taken the place for transporting goods and products through the country. But weak and narrow roads can’ t bear the load of heavy transports and break down very easily. The huge number of trucks carrying goods are also responsible for traffic jams and causes trouble for the passengers traveling in public transports. Where a huge opportunity of transportation is just unused dew to right maintenance. The lessen navigability is also alarming for defunct creatures of our rivers. This is causes damage to biodiversity 	and imbalance in water ecosystem and food chain by almost vanishing so many rare species.\\
	The purpose of designed system is using technology in a well planed way for the betterment of our transportation system, lifestyle and environment. As the main cause of lessen navigability is not dredging at time, I have designed system that can be attached with a water vehicle to measure if the navigability of a water body is right for large water vehicles or not. If it found any water body with less navigability it will star an indicator and send the location of water body to a preset number of responsible authority via mobile messaging system to ensure dredging in proper time. I have tried to come with a cheap solution so that it won’t be a burden to our economy and can be used easily in practical fields. I have used Arduino Uno, GSM module, sonar sensor, buzzer, LED, GPS module and bluetooth module. Sonar and GPS technology will identify the location that requires dredging, GSM will transfer the information. Buzzer and LED are cheap optional additions for easily recognizing the place, whenever the device will find a low navigable area, it will indicate that to the present users with its light and sound. Bluetooth will be used for transfering the data to a computer and store them in a excel sheet.
	\chapter{Introduction}
	\section{Introduction}
	Once very popular and feasible water transportation system of Bangladesh has almost vanished. It can be revived easily if the navigability of our inland waterways taken care by providing regular dredging facilities. This can be the solution to our unwanted traffic jams and make the adventurous water rides available to us. In this Chapter we will introduce the knowledge of IoT, motivation, problem statement, and objectives of the project.
	\section{Problem Definition}
	Lossing navigability is a continious natural process for any river. Though the sedmentation rate of the rivers varies from one to another but lossing navigability gradually is a very natural occurance. But if the waterbodies lose their ideal navigability it will be a threat for water transportation system as well as the creatures. Besides, it will create problems like floodes, irrigation problems etc. This problems can be handled by maintaining the ideal navigability of a river. So I have developed a system that will notify low navigabilityof a water body, so the necessery steps to achive it's ideal navigability can be taken.  
	\section{Motivation}
	Bangladesh has a huge network of inland waterways. These waterways should go through a dredging process regularly, otherwise they’ll lose their navigability dew to natural sedimentation and human created pollution. Besides destroying our inbuilt god gifted network of transportation low navigability can also destroy the biodiversity by vanishing the living environment of many water creatures. In rainy seasons floods come as a curse to us. Low navigable waterways can easily lead to floods by causing overflow in rainy seasons. Low navigable dried up rivers also cause hazard in irrigation system, that leads to a fall in our agriculture and economy.   
This huge loss can be reversed to huge opportunities by ensuring the dredging facilities to our rivers at a regular basis, for which measuring there navigability regularly is needed. Traditional system is not suitable for this monitoring system as it’s a huge task for monitoring these measurements punctually using manual approach. Some of them are:-
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item Measuring navigability on a regular basis.
	\item Measuring regularly using manpower can be so difficult in following cases:
		\begin{description}
			\item [Case 1:] It needs a good amount of trained and experienced manpower to do the measuring tasks.	
			\item [Case 2:] It includes some arrangements.
			\item [Case 3:] Recruitment and training of people and regular manual task will demand more money.
			\item [Case 4:] Manual process will be time consuming. It always lacks efficiency.
			\item [Case 5:] Locating the exact geographical location is not possible by human.
			\item [Case 6:] No manual system can give nonstop service.
		\end{description}
	\item Sending the information efficiently to the responsible authority.
	\end{enumerate}
 An IoT based device can provide more information in less effort and less man power. The IoT based navigability monitoring system will not just revive our oldest system of transportation in a technology enriched manner but also serve the universal purpose of reserving the biodiversity and save rare species from total defunction.
	\section{Overview of Solution Approach and Ideas}
	The project can be done using IoT based approach. An Arduino Uno board will be used to collect data, control all the data flow and system mechanism. Sonar sensor and GPS (Global Positioning System) will collect the data and GSM (Global System for Mobile Communication), buzzer and LED will perform the actions after processing the data. Information will be served to the authority using the GSM. A bluetooth module can be easily added to the system for continiously uploading all readings of the system for further calculation. This will improve the decision of starting dredging in any particular area. The solution is elaborately described below:-
	\subsection{Develop a system that can detect low navigability}
	Objective of this system is detecting low navigability of the waterways so that the information can be passed to the responsible authority. This task would be done by using sonar sensor.
	\subsection{Develop a system that can track location}
	Objective of the system is detecting the latitude and longitude of a low navigability area. This task would be done by using GPS module.
	\subsection{Develop a system that can transfer information}
	Objective of this system is transferring the information and location of low navigability area via SMS to the responsible authority. This task would be done by using GSM modue.
	\subsection{Develop a system that can provide sign}
	Objective of this system is to develop a system that can provide visual and audio indication like buzzing alarm and blinking LED. This task would be done by using buzzer and LED light.
	\subsection{Develop a system that can store data}
	This is an additional mechanism of the system, it will be usefull during thorough servey of a river/ waterbody. This mechanism includes a bluetooth module and  a laptop. The bluetooth module will transfer all retrived data to the laptopfor and save them i a excel sheet for further analysis.

	\section{Significance of Work}
		IoT stands for “ Internet of Things”. We know that there are many system having interaction with human and computer. But IoT is totally different which refers to a system of interrelated computing devices and mechanical digital machines, objects, animals or people that are provided with unique identifiers and the ability to transfer data over a network without requiring human to human or human-to-computer interaction. 
		At this era of technology the use of IoT is increasing year-over-year, approximately 31\% and number of connected devices installed based on IoT are 23.14 billions in 2018. The global market value of IoT is projected to reach \$7.1 trillion by 2020. IoT involves extending internet connectivity beyond standard devices, such as desktops, laptops, smartphones, and tablets, to any range of traditionally dumb or non-internet enabled physical devices and everyday objects. Embedded with technology, these devices can communicate and interact over the internet, and they can be remotely monitored and controlled. IoT is the way to build up smart devices for a smarter life.\\
		The ultrasonic sonar sensor is largely used to measure depth both in under water and over water.GPS based technology are largely used for tracking systems, location determining systems. GSM was mainly designed to be used in 2g and 3g mobile networks, now many IoT devices use this for communication with the end user via SMS and phone calls. This project is an experiment of combining this technologies and use them for solution of low navigability problem of our inland waterways.   
		The purpose of the project is detecting low navigable states of inland waterways. The ideal for routing goods ship is 3.048 m. So for deciding a waterway is well navigable or not we need to measure if the depth of water body is greater then 3.048m or not.In this project I have declared the alarming depth 4m as after notifying the authority will need some time to arrange the dredging program.\\
		The system uses a sonar based mechanism to detect navigability less then alarming depth. When such a depth is detected it turns on an indicator designed with combination of a buzzer and a LED. The system notes the location of low navigable areas location and transfer the information using GPS and GSM module.\\
	\chapter{Description of the System}
		\section{Introduction}
		This is a navigability measurement system that has the ability to monitor the navigability of the waterways, generate warning while finding a low navigability area, detect its location details and inform authority to take necessary dredging operations in the detected location. In this section we will show the block diagram, and methodology of the system. 
		\section{System Model}
		As we can see in the flow chart, the system searches for depth lower than 4m. After finding such a depth it turns on audio visual indicator that will help users to memorize the location and easily finding them. It stores a the latitude and longitude of starting location and keep measuring the depth in search of depth higher than 4m. As it finds the higher depth it notes the latitude and longitude again and forward the information of location with the value of average navigability of that place. Optionally it has a system to transfer all readings to a computer using bluetooth. This can be helpful for thorough examination of a river.The block diagram represents the systems working principal of the system which can define the overall process.

			\subsubsection{GSM Module}
			GSM is a system for Global Mobile Communication which is used in cellular network in 2G or 2.5G based on TDMA multiplexing technique. It’s developed by European telecommunication standard. It is used in infrastructure system networks. There are many types of GSM. In this system we will use GSM module SIM900A for this system for connecting with the cellular network.  There is a SIM slot where a SIM card can be inserted.This module need to be powered from a constant 5v power source.

			LED (Light Emitting Diode) emits the light when there is a flow of a current. The different color represents the different voltage recognition. This semiconductor light source emits the energy as like photon when the electron of the semiconductor recombined with the electron holes. This type of effect is called electroluminescence. There are two pins in LED where the longest pin is Vcc and the smaller pin is GND. The different color LED is the reason for different voltage. For example, white LED runs on 3.2V. In this system we will use an red LED to indicate the low navigability area and a green LED to indicate established power supply.

		\end{figure}
		This is the developed system of the proposal. This chapter is for discussing its readings.\\
		In this chapter we will discuss the results, compare them, check there validation to reach the conclusion.
		\section{Graphs and Tables}
		The graphs and tables generated from the experiment is given below.
		\begin{figure}[h!]

		\newpage
		A terminal software Tera Term is used to generate this excel files. An screen shot of Tera Term is given below:

		\section{Parameter Values}
		The parameters for the mathematical calculation in this system are time and length(depth). We have used the unit of time as microseconds and unit of length (depth/ navigability) as meter. \\
		So,\\
		The velocity of ultrasonic sound in water = (1500/10\^\ 6)meter /micro second. = .0015 m/ms.\\
		
		\section{Validation}
		For checking the validation of the system I have tested the performance of the system in a real environment. I have used the system for taking readings of river Shitalokkha and some screen shots of the readings of the serial monitor is given below.
		\begin{figure}[h!]	
			\centering
			\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{Untitled2.png}
			\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{Untitled.png}
			\caption{Navigability Readings of River Shitalokkha}
		\end{figure} 
		So the developed system works well in the real environment. Though, there are some conditions of its working properly.
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item A strong and steady structure will help the system working easily.
			\item Enough power supply need to be ensured for smooth working of the system.
		\end{enumerate}
		\section{Comparison}
		Powerful sonars have been used for various researches im marine science, marine biology and oceanography. They are also used largely in many ocean related applications. The have a large accuracy range. So, the can be used easily to scan under water land surface or ocean depth. \\
		The sonar sensor I have used is an inexpensive one that can measure distance accurately accurately from 25cm to 450cm. So, this can't trace the exact depth or scan the underwater land surface. But, it can work well enough to detect low navigability. So its ideal to build an inexpensive cheap system that can be produced in large amount and used in daily basis for particularly detecting low navigability.
		\section{Result Discussion}
		The system detects area location less then 4m and forward the information to responsible authority. In most cases the system works well, except some false readings from the sonar.This can be easily handled by adding some conditions in the program and ignoring unusual peaks in a plot.
		\begin{figure}[h!]

		\end{figure} 
		\section{significance}
		On the basis of above discussion, I claim that my developed system has fulfilled the purposes of the project and the obtained results have claimed the contributions. 
		\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work}
		\section {Conclusion}
		The system I have developed is an inexpensive solution of monitoring the navigability state of our inland waterways. It's enable to provide notifications to the responsible authority to arrange dredging to regain lost navigability.\\
		It's designed using portable power system to make it a fully portable device that allows it to work in minimum facilities. GSM network is used so it won't require any internet connection to work and easily operate in underdeveloped rural areas.
		\section{Future Works}
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Developing an web based system for continuous data transfer.
			\item Sending mail notification. 
			\item Data storing in SD card.
